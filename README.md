# Draw-it-or-lose-it
Software design document for draw it or lose it game.

Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client name was The Gaming Room. The software required by The Gaming room was a game known as draw it or lose it. In this Game multiple teams comprised of multiple players will compete to guess a image that gradually appears over a set amount of time.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I beleive I did well in outlining how the game is to fuction a well as showing the flow of data with a uml diagram.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The most useful aspect of the design document for me was the Doimain model as it outlined what classes would be utilized by other classes.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
-Addition of details regarding the freasability of mobile devices as a server side option.
-Make the demonstration of data a bit more organized for easier readability.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
As the number of teams was specified to be 0 or greater, that brings with it the possibility of single team games. I have taken this into consideration in the document.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
My initial plan when developing software is to outline how the software should function from a minimal standpoint so that it may be built off of for frequent testing. Another early step I take is planning how data will flow through this program.
For a similar application I would employ the general planning phase as mentioned above but with the addition of peer critisism before taking action on the plan. This would ultimately save time in the loing run if there were to be an error in my plan.
